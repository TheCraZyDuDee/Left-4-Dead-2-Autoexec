# Left 4 Dead 2 Autoexec

My own Personal Autoexec i worked on for the past Years.</br>
Each Category and Command has an explanation and is easily customizable or is expandable by executing your own Config.

## Usage
Download the Repository as .zip and extract the autoexec.cfg and configs folder into left4dead2\cfg, default path is:</br>
```
"C:\Steam\steamapps\common\Left 4 Dead 2\left4dead2\cfg"
```
Recommended Launch Arguments can be found [here](https://github.com/TheCraZyDuDee/Left-4-Dead-2-Autoexec/blob/main/launch_arguments.md)<br>
Recommended Video Settings can be found [here](https://github.com/TheCraZyDuDee/Left-4-Dead-2-Autoexec/blob/main/video_settings.md)

Anything else i tried to explain as good as i can in the actual config itself
