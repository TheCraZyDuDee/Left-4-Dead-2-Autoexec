# crustySenpais-Left-4-Dead-2-Autoexec
Just my Autoexec so People can use it if they want :)
Most Stuff is copied from other cfg's so don't expect to much.
Has everything i need so  ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯

Put the autoexec.cfg in C:\Steam\steamapps\common\Left 4 Dead 2\left4dead2\cfg or wherever you installed your Game.
Anything else is in the cfg explained as much as i could.
